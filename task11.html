            <p>AB Airlines was an airline with its head office in the Enterprise House on the property of London Stansted Airport in Uttlesford, Essex.[1] AB was one of the first 'low-cost airlines' in England, preceding others such as EasyJet, Ryanair, and Go Fly. It was created in 1993 by former Brymon Airways executives. AB Airlines was formerly known as Air Bristol. Initially the airline marketed itself as Air Belfast, reflecting its then principal route between Belfast International Airport and London Stansted. Aircraft and crew were based at Belfast International Airport, London Stansted Airport and Bristol Filton Airport. A base was opened in 1994 at Shannon Airport to operate flights to London Gatwick Airport. This operation was marketed as AB Shannon.</p>
